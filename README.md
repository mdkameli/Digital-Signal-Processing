There is an audio file with sample frequency of 48Kh which consist of two real audio information signals. The procedure is to first of all demodulate the pass-band signals to base-band by using the two sinusoidal carriers of the audio file. Second of all filter the demodulated signal and extract the real audio information. Finally store the signals and combine them in channel.
